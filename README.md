# Travelling salesman problem
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the problem of finding the shortest and most efficient route for a person to take given a list of specific destinations. It is a well-known algorithmic problem in the fields of computer science. This problem can be solved using the Graph data structures. This problem is handled at much higher complexity in modern world with lots of maps and mapping applications.


1. Create and display a simple graph with N nodes where the nodes.
2. Display a help menu and the user can interact with that.
3. Add new node in the graph and asking user to input distances to
   other nodes. 
4. Verify that the node Inserted by the user is valid, i.e. input contains
   distances to all the nodes already existing in the graph are presented. 
5. Recalculate the fastest route to visit all the nodes after insertion.
6. Allow user to delete a node present in the graph. When user select the delete option,
   print a list of all node names and allow user to choose which node to delete. After
   removing the node from the graph, recalculate the fastest route to visit all the nodes,


### Step 1: cmake .
### Step 2: make
### Step 3: ./main
